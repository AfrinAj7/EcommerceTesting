🎯 Selenium Java Automation Testing Framework with Reporting
This project is a Java-based Selenium automation framework designed for comprehensive end-to-end testing of web applications. It includes setups for Allure Reports and Extent Reports to produce detailed and interactive test execution summaries. The framework is structured for flexibility and scalability, supporting various test scenarios like login validation, UI verification, and form submission.

🔑 Key Features
🧩 Automated Test Scenarios
Functional Testing: Verifies product search, add-to-cart, and checkout workflows.
Login Validation: Tests login functionality with both valid and invalid credentials.
UI Testing: Ensures visibility and functionality of key UI elements.
Form Validation: Checks for required fields, input constraints, and correct form submission.
📊 Detailed Reporting
Allure Reports: Generate step-by-step reports with optional screenshots.
Extent Reports: Interactive, color-coded HTML reports summarizing test results.
⚙️ Error Handling & Scalability
Integrated error logging for streamlined debugging and issue tracking.
Modular setup with reusable functions and parameterized inputs to support scalable testing.
🗂 Project Structure
src/main/java: Core utilities, such as WebDriver setup, configurations, and reusable functions.
src/test/java: Categorized test cases organized by functionality.
testng.xml: Configuration file to structure and run test suites with TestNG.
pom.xml: Manages project dependencies and Maven plugins for Java.
🚀 Getting Started
📋 Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+
Maven: For dependency management and project execution.
Google Chrome Browser: (Ensure ChromeDriver version compatibility)
📥 Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-java-automation-framework.git
cd selenium-java-automation-framework
Install Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Setup ChromeDriver: WebDriverManager handles ChromeDriver versions automatically to match the installed Chrome version.

Run Tests: Execute the test suite using Maven and TestNG:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
🔧 Configuring Tests
To customize test parameters or configurations, edit the testng.xml file or adjust settings in src/main/resources/config.properties if specific environment or browser configurations are needed.

📑 Generating Reports
📈 Allure Report
Allure Reports provide an interactive, detailed view of each test case.

After running tests, generate the Allure report by using:
bash
Copy code
allure serve target/allure-results
This command starts a local server and opens the report in your default browser.
🖥️ Extent Report
Extent Reports generate an HTML file with color-coded results and a visual breakdown of each test case.

After running tests, locate the extent-report.html file in the project root directory and open it in a browser to view the report.
📝 Code Example
Here's a sample test case for validating the login functionality:

java
Copy code
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import io.qameta.allure.*;

public class LoginTest {

    @Epic("Authentication")
    @Feature("Login Tests")
    @Story("User logs in with valid credentials")
    @Test(description = "Valid Login Test with Correct Username and Password")
    public void validLoginTest() {
        WebDriver driver = DriverSetup.getDriver();
        driver.get("https://example.com/login");

        LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
        loginPage.enterUsername("testUser");
        loginPage.enterPassword("password123");
        loginPage.clickLogin();

        Assert.assertTrue(loginPage.isLoginSuccessful(), "Login was not successful.");
    }
}
🛠 Troubleshooting
ChromeDriver Issues
If ChromeDriver is not detected, ensure the browser version matches WebDriverManager by updating the Chrome version or clearing the WebDriver cache:

java
Copy code
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().clearCache();
Dependency Issues
If you encounter dependency issues, run:

bash
Copy code
mvn dependency:resolve
This ensures all required dependencies are correctly downloaded.
